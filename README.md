# ELK Architecture Implementation
The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Metricbeat, Filebeat, Fleet Server, and APM) is used to efficiently collect, store, analyze, and visualize security events and application performance in a containerized cloud environment. This stack monitors infrastructure, applications, and security events, providing full visibility into the platform's health and security.
Components:
## Elasticsearch:
A distributed search engine that stores and indexes logs, metrics, and performance data. It enables fast, efficient querying of security data across the cloud platform.
Role: Centralized storage for all logs, performance metrics, and security events.
## Kibana:
A user-friendly graphical interface that provides interactive visualizations, dashboards, and monitoring tools for logs, metrics, and security events stored in Elasticsearch.
Role: Visualize and explore security events, application performance, and system metrics.
## Logstash:
An open-source tool that processes, filters, and transforms logs and security events before sending them to Elasticsearch.
Role: Log transformation, filtering, enrichment, and forwarding.
## Metricbeat:
Collects system and container-level metrics, such as CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, and network traffic. It can also gather metrics from Docker and Kubernetes environments, making it ideal for cloud platforms.
Role: Collect and forward system and container metrics for performance and security analysis.
## Filebeat:
A lightweight shipper that collects and forwards log data from applications (e.g., security logs, system logs) to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
Role: Collect and forward log data for analysis.
## Fleet Server:
Manages Elastic Agents that collect data from containers and systems for monitoring and security purposes.
Role: Central management and configuration of Elastic Agents.
## Elastic Agent:
A unified agent for collecting logs, metrics, and security data across a variety of sources, including containers and cloud services. It can also monitor security events and performance anomalies.
Role: Collect and send performance and security data from containers, cloud instances, and infrastructure.
## APM (Application Performance Monitoring):
Monitors the performance of applications in real-time, providing deep insights into application transactions, response times, and errors. It tracks the performance of application code and detects bottlenecks, slowdowns, or failures.
Role: Monitor and visualize the performance of applications and services running in containers or cloud environments, allowing quick detection of performance issues or security risks.
Integration: APM integrates with Elasticsearch to store and analyze performance data, and with Kibana for visualizations of application performance, such as transaction times, error rates, and system resources.
## Certificate Configuration:
Ensures secure communication between all components of the ELK stack, using SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt data transmission.
Role: Secure communication within the ELK stack and between all services (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet Server, Elastic Agents, etc.).
